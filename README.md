# KADE-submission4
This is my submission for the third assessment project in Dicoding "Kotlin Android Developer Expert" course. In the third part of this course, we have learned about testing applications on Kotlin both in unit and instrumentation tests. Now is the time for you to apply it to applications that you have made.

Modify the application project in the previous submission by adding unit tests and instrumentation tests. This is a prerequisite task so that you can proceed to the final project.

## Testing Criteria

* **Unit Test**
  * Apply unit tests on all functions to get match data from the API (league details, next Match, previous match, match details, search match).

* **Instrumentation Tests**
  * Implement an instrumentation test to ensure the match search feature runs properly.
  * Write the instrumentation test scenario in the notes column when you want to submit this assignment.
  
* Maintain features and components that existed in the previous submission.

## Notes
* You are free to use third-party networking libraries, for example Retrofit, Rx, etc.
* You are free to use third-party testing libraries such as Specs, Robolectric, etc.

### The opportunity for your submission to be accepted will be greater if:
* Write the test scenario clearly.
* Implement unit tests properly and correctly.
* Implement instrumentation tests properly.
* Use patterns like MVP, MVVM, Architecture Component or others.
* Write the code clean.
